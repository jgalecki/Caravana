x You reach the oasis in one piece.
z What were those things?
Saul The Faded?
Soliel Bits of faded dreams and memories, raging against time and nothingness.
Saul When a person dies, their memory lives on through those they knew in life.
Saul But as time goes on, their friends and family grow old and memories of the person dim.
Saul In time, the person's life will be forgotten and the spirit will fade to non-existence.
Saul Most accept this.
Saul Some spirits grow restless at the prospect. 
Soliel Others grow violent and take out their anger on anything passing by.
Soliel They wander the desert aimlessly.
Saul The desert Lum is a dangerous place, especially for the unprepared.
Soliel But the prepared can make a fortune by crossing the dangerous wastes.
Soliel The second sun is setting, night is coming at last.
Soliel We shall rest here and leave in the morning.
x You spend the night on a comfortable bed roll.
x You sleep a dreamless sleep.
x You wake up and prepare for the day's journey.
Soliel We leave for the city of Haghreb. The city has a thousand and one wonders waiting for travelers.
Saul And a thousand and one deals to be made. 
x The camels are packed and ready to go. You set off.
x The hours wander as Saul and Soliel pass the time trading stories.
x You see another group of Faded approaching.
